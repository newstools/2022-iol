But data made available by Global Petrol Prices earlier this year, cited Zimbabwe as the country with the highest petrol cost on the continent. According to ZimLive.com, Zimbabwe’s central bank said last week that the price of bread would go down after it held talks with an association of bakers. Governor John Mangudya said bakers had complained over a lack of access to foreign currency to import wheat and procure fuel for deliveries, the local news outlet reported.   Bakers recently raised the price of bread from US$1 to an average $1.20 in response to rising fuel prices, disruptions to global wheat supply chains caused by the Ukraine war and lack of access to foreign currency to fund imports. The Grain Millers Association of Zimbabwe (GMAZ) in April also increased the prices of maize and wheat by 50% and 17,8%, respectively. Analysts say that the rising price of fuel has directly impacted the price of bread in the southern Africa country that has been battling rapidly growing inflation, leaving the poor worst affected.   The Zimbabwean Independent reports that the country will require to import 155 000 tonnes of wheat to mitigate the variance between local production and national demand. In 2008-2009, hyperinflation reached 500 billion%, according to the International Monetary Fund. At the time, 100 trillion Zimbabwean dollar banknotes were not enough to buy basic groceries, writes Africanews. IOL
