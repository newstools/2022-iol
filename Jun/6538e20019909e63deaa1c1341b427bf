We will keep standing against evil and Nigeria will win.” Emergency agencies are to swing into action to assist the wounded. “We stand in utter solidarity with the people of Owo and Ondo state in this terrible moment,” Osinbajo concluded.  Visuals of the terrorists attack at St Francis Xavier Catholic Church Owo, Ondo State, is a gory scene. I wish it’s from a movie scene, only it’s not.
