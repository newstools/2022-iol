Johannesburg – With a large number of young people unemployed there are two factors that seem to exacerbate the problem – qualifications and experience. It is a well-known fact that not all young people who complete matric have the opportunity to further their education at the tertiary level. Sure, interventions such as NSFAS grants go a long way in helping alleviate the burden on students and their families but not everyone will qualify for funding. So what becomes of the students who have completed Grade 12 but are unable to study further? Below are some job opportunities in the Western Cape that require only matric.
