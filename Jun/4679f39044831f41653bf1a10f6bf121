By Lihle Sosibo Top of their class, Dr Ishq Pramchand and Dr Ra’Eesa Mohamed-Yunus each graduated with a Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery (MBChB) degree summa cum laude from the University of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN). “I feel honoured and humbled. The achievement is a culmination of constant effort made possible by the unwavering support of my family and friends. I intend to specialise, either as a surgeon or a physician,” said Pramchand, who is currently a first-year intern at King Edward Hospital focusing on Paediatrics. “I feel privileged to have navigated medicine in the local setting and I hope to learn as much as I can to give back to my community. I couldn’t think of myself as anything else but a doctor. Helping others and giving back to my community is a fulfilling oath which I will swear by.” Pramchand describes his university experience as incredible, life-changing and humbling. “I can’t help but feel a little nostalgic when I reflect on my university years. I loved it. UKZN implores students to become critical thinkers and leaders. I have felt so confident throughout my three months of internship, and I look forward to every day at the hospital”. Mohamed-Yunus said she couldn’t believe how well she had done. “It took a while for reality to sink in and I still haven’t completely accepted it; I was just happy to pass. This achievement was the culmination of years of hard work and a lot of blood, sweat and tears.” Following her childhood dream, Mohamed-Yunus said she’s planning to specialise in Paediatrics. “I love the Paediatrics field and I feel content with life seeing a smile on a person’s face after they have received treatment.”
