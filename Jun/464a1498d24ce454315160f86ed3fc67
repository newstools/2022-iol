Johannesburg - A funeral service was held yesterday for three siblings, aged 6, 13 and 16, who died tragically a week ago in Ratanda, Heidelberg, after they unsuspectingly drank a poison-spiked energy drink. The service for the children – Lehlohonolo Khoabane, Katleho Khoabane and Teboho Ngcongwane – was held at the Ratanda Multi-Purpose Centre. The father of the three, who the police said they found in an unconscious state near Heidelberg, has been hospitalised after an apparent failed suicide attempt. Police confirmed he has been charged with three counts of murder and one of attempted murder. Family members allege it was the father who offered the children the beverage. A fourth sibling who drank the poisoned beverage remains in a critical condition. A fifth did not consume the drink.  The three children who died were pupils at the Ratanda Primary and Khanya Lesedi Secondary schools. Police said the family member who allegedly poisoned the four siblings is under police guard.  Police spokesperson Brigadier Brenda Muridili confirmed that the father of the children is a suspect.  One of the children, Neo Khoabane, 11, is in a critical condition at the Thelle Mogoerane Regional Hospital.   Story and pictures by  Bhekikhaya Mabaso African News Agency (ANA)
