There are numerous types of mental health disorders with varying degrees of impacts on one's life. However, they should all be taken seriously. One of these illnesses that can affect one's work is obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), which Dr Gwen Tonyane, a psychiatrist practising at Netcare Akeso in Randburg highlights. She describes obsessions as recurrent and persistent thoughts, urges, or images that come to mind, but are intrusive and unwanted, causing the person anxiety or distress.
