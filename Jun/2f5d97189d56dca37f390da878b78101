Work-integrated learning (WIL), also known as in-service training, is when a student in their final year of tertiary education is employed as an intern by an organisation in their field to gain work experience.  Such programmes allow students to apply the skills and knowledge they gained from their studies in a real workplace, giving companies an extra set of hands and giving the students some much-need experience. Often, these programmes also pay students a small stipend. In most higher learning institutions, a work-integrated learning programme is necessary in order to graduate.
