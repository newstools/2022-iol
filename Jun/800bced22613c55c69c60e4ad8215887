She said 23 of the more than 200 stalls have been burnt. She also said that the cause of the fire has not been determined. According to several reports, shop owners have said they have received verbal threats from the Operation Dudula movement and have been told that if they do not leave, their shops will be burnt down. Speaking to the Daily Maverick, the spokesperson of Operation Dudula, Zandile Dubula, said the information she received said the fire was caused by a faulty heater. “If they have proof, they need to bring it forward. We at Operation Dudula do not promote criminality. So if it’s one of our members, then we will let the law take its course,” Dubula was quoted saying.
