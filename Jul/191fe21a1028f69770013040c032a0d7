Cape Town: As Boris Johnson resigned on Thursday, Russian officials celebrated his downfall, with Russian tycoon Oleg Deripaska calling him a “stupid clown” who got his reward for arming Ukrainian soldiers against Russia. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Johnson “really does not like us” and made it clear that Russia “does not like him either”. Peskov added that he hoped more “professional people” would take charge in London in order for the nations to make decisions through dialogue. Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said Johnson’s fall was due to the decline of the West and added that he had been “hit by a boomerang launched by himself”. To be a leader – to call 🇷🇺 evil a evil and to take responsibility in the hardest times. To be a leader – to be the first to arrive in Kyiv, despite missile attacks. Thanks @BorisJohnson for realizing the threat of RF monster and always being at the forefront of supporting 🇺🇦. pic.twitter.com/vIuXVjUbzG While Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky who held a close relationship with Johnson is yet to publicly release a statement, his advise,r Mykhailo Podolyak, shared his views on social media and thanked Johnson for being “the first to arrive in Kyiv” to support Ukraine.
