Meanwhile, according to the Namibian on Tuesday, the Southern African country’s minister of mines and energy Tom Alweendo on Saturday withdrew from the Khomas region's Swapo Party Elders' Council elections. Alweendo was expected to contest for the council's treasurer position, the local news outlet reported. The Namibian reports that he withdrew from the election because he allegedly does not meet the requirements to be eligible for the position, since he does not serve in any structure of the party in the region. The elders' council's regional conference in Windhoek elected Selma Utoni as regional secretary, while Gideon Ishitile has been elected as regional information secretary. Alweendo is one of Swapo's leaders speculated to contest for the Swapo vice-president position at the party's elective congress later this year, writes the publication. In 2014, the Southern African nation was the first African country to use electronic voting machines during a general election. IOL
