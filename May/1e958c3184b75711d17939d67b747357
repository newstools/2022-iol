In its trading statement released yesterday, the group said that during the current period, earnings per share were expected to increase approximating 455.8 cents to 484.3 cents, to between 740.8 cents and 769.3 cents, off a base of 285 cents reported for the prior comparative period. Headline earning per share is expected to be within 20 percent of the prior comparative period, off a base of 316 cents reported for the prior comparative period. According to the group, the earnings include: a net profit on disposal of businesses, 51.19 percent of Kian Ann and ESG branches, amounting to approximately R64 million (59 cents per share) "A fair value gain of approximately R396 million (366 cents per share) on remeasurement of the joint venture investments, KKB roller manufacture operation and the MIH product distribution operations in both the US and Canada where holdings were increased to 100 percent.“ The company said the above transactions were included in earnings per share (Eps) but excluded from headline earnings (Heps) in the current period.

This follows the firm’s return to a better financial footing after reducing its overheads and debt burden.  BUSINESS REPORT
