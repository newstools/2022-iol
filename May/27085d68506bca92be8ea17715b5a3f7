Durban - The Employment Insight Report for April, produced by the employment website CareerJunction, showed some interesting hiring trends. "Following the highly elevated levels of recruitment activity during the first quarter of the year, the number of advertised vacancies dropped slightly in April. "However, recruitment activity over the past 13 months still reflects a strong hiring trend, increasing by 32 percent between April 2021 and April 2022," said CareerJunction. According to the report, Finance, Business and Management, as well as Admin, Ofﬁce and Support, have seen the biggest increase in hiring activity. Business and Management (Middle/ Senior department management, Staff Recruitment/ Selection, along with Team Leaders and supervisors) saw an increase of 11 percent. Admin, Ofﬁce and Support (Switchboard/ Reception, Human Resources, Client/ Customer Support, Admin Clerk) grew by 23 percent. Finance (Purchasing and Procurement, Cost and Management Accounting, Bookkeeping, Financial / Project Accounting) saw a 17 percent uptick. Surprisingly, the hiring activity for Information Technology (Software Development, IT Project Administration/ Management) decreased by three percent in the past three months. CareerJunction says despite this drop,  IT continues to be a top-performing employment sector in the country. "This decline may be partly attributed to increased emigration as travel restrictions are relaxed, as well as the growing trend of ‘digital nomads’ in the IT space." IOL Business
