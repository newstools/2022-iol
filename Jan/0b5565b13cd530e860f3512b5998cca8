The deceased met their untimely death at a very young age and in such a tragic manner. It is really unfortunate. My sincere condolences,” Lehari said. “It takes a split second for a person to lose their life. We, therefore plead with road users to pay extra attention and be extra careful.” A case of culpable homicide was opened.
