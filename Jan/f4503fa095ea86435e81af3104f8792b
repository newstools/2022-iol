TikTok is currently the most popular social media network among younger generations, especially tweens and teens, or Gen Alpha and Gen Z. The Chinese-founded video-sharing app has attracted people from all demographics. TikTok, like any other social network, could be a challenge to get started on.  Who do you follow, what videos do you make, and in particular how does it work? How do you navigate TikTok, and how do you know how and where to find your tribe? “To help kick things off, we invite new users to select categories of interest, like pets or travel, to help tailor recommendations to their preferences,” said TikTok. The app initially offers a helping hand by suggesting a few topics.  This shapes your feed and is an important step in the process of discovering like-minded people on the same wavelength. So don’t be hasty and click on the “Skip” option right away.  After following a few accounts, the “Following” page – which is one of two tabs on TikTok’s opening screen upon entry, the other being “For You” – displays the most recent posts from every account you follow on the platform. Subcultures Although TikTok is known for its trendy challenges, the site offers much more besides. It boasts many advantages, one being that it can be used as a business tool for brands. There are niche interests aplenty on this platform, and you're sure to find your tribe on this social media network… guaranteed. Various subcultures originated on TikTok, while existing ones gained popularity on the site. TikTok is an expressive world where anything goes.
