By Zhong Wenxing, Xian Jiangnan  "We must put people and their lives first. The battle with Covid-19 is one for the people and by the people." "What has happened proves that to completely defeat the virus, we must put people's lives and health front and center, demonstrate a great sense of political responsibility and courage, and make extraordinary responses to an extraordinary challenge. No effort must be spared to attend every case, save every patient, and truly respect the value and dignity of every human life. Meanwhile, it is also important to minimize the potential impact on people's life and maintain general order in our society. " Chinese President Xi Jinping delivered a speech at the Global Health Summit via video in Beijing on May 21, 2021. "China is always a builder of world peace, contributor to global development, defender of the international order and provider of public goods. China will continue to bring the world new opportunities through its new development."
