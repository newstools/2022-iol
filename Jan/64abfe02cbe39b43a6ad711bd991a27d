The fund’s mandate is to invest in start-up businesses that align to Tiger Brands’ consumer-relevant growth platforms of health and nutrition, “snackification”, and economical food options, and to grow these businesses alongside the entrepreneurs running them. Becky Opdyke, chief marketing officer at Tiger Brands, said through the Venture Capital Fund, the company is looking to expand participation in new product categories and access a pipeline of opportunities to fuel future growth. “As our first Venture Capital Fund Director, Barati brings valuable private equity and commercial finance experience along with an understanding of the consumer goods sector.” Mahloele has more than a decade of experience in commercial finance and private equity. She began her finance career at Unilever where she held roles in South Africa, Kenya, Ethiopia, the UK, and Australia. In Kenya and Ethiopia, she was involved in greenfield investment projects. At Zebu, a pan-African private equity fund manager investing across the food value chain, Mahloele led the fund’s technology-enabled investments and was instrumental in their consumer goods investments across East and Southern Africa.
