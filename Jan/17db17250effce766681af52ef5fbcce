IOL reported that officials were investigating the circumstances of the fire. According to provincial police spokesperson Sergeant Wesley Twigg, Cape Town Central police opened an arson docket for investigation after a fire was reported in Queen Victoria Street in Cape Town.  “No one was arrested," he said.  Meanwhile, Paul Makaula, the man accused of breaking the windows at the Constitutional Court, appeared in the Hillbrow Magistrate’s Court yesterday. He is facing a charge of malicious damage to property and was remanded in custody until March 25 after abandoning his bail application.  NPA spokesperson Phindi Mjonondwane said the investigation process was at an early stage and more charges were likely to be added in terms of the National Key Points Act.  Investigations conducted by Lieutenant-Colonel Ingrid Simons revealed that Makaula is a parolee after he had been sentenced to 15 years in 2010 for murder. This information would be forwarded to the Department of Correctional Services for further processing. IOL
