THE recent Bitcoin price correction has resulted in Bitcoin millionaires ranks plummeting by more than 24 percent in three months, according to data acquired by Finbold. It said yesterday that the drop in the Bitcoin rich list correlated with the asset’s volatility that had been heightened in recent weeks, saying, “A combination of factors such as regulatory scrutiny, turbulent markets, geopolitical unrest, and Covid had an adverse effect on the asset’s performance." The executive board of the International Monetary Fund on Tuesday urged El Salvador to remove the cryptocurrency Bitcoin's legal tender status, citing large risks to financial stability. Between October 2021 and January 2022, the number of Bitcoin addresses holding more than $1 million (R15m) had decreased by 28 186, or 24.26 percent.
