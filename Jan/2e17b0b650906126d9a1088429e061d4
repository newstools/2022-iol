Western Cape MEC for Health Dr Nomafrench Mbombo congratulated the families welcoming their newborns. “I wish to congratulate all parents on the safe arrival of their newborns and wish them many years of happiness and good health. May you cherish the time together with your little ones, as parenthood is one of the best journeys,” she said. Mbombo said a child’s health was most vulnerable during the first 1 000 days of its life. The period from conception until a child’s second birthday offered a unique window of opportunity (for parents) to shape healthier and more prosperous futures. “We as the Western Cape government health (department) are excited to be part of this journey, from your baby’s first immunisation to their first steps. We are here to support you. “It is important to create a nurturing and healthy environment for your baby, along with good nutrition, which can impact a child’s ability to develop and learn. “Ensure that your baby is fully immunised and follow the advice of health workers at your local clinic. “Make time to play with your child and support him or her as they grow and develop. Remember to take care of yourself as well,” Mbombo added. robin.francke@inl.co.za IOL
