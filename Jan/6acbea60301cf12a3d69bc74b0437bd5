South African rugby star Tendai ’Beast’ Mtawarira’s foundation is partnering with Henley Business School to award five semi-professional and professional athletes’ scholarships.  Mtawarira who founded the Beast Foundation is a graduate from Henley Business School Africa with a Post Graduate Diploma in Business Management. He is currently an MBA student and says he is striving to empower himself, and to serve as a role model to other athletes to build a life and career beyond sport. The scholarships will cover both registration and tuition fees for the duration of the chosen qualification. Athletes in the country as well as non-South Africans with the necessary study permits are encouraged to apply.  Applicants must be between 22 and 30 years of age, possess a matriculation or undergraduate qualification recognized by the South African Qualifications Authority (SAQA). Mtawarira says because sports careers have a limited lifespan, through providing these scholarships, he believes the foundation is offering athletes options and a sustainable career path.  “The value of education is paramount in broadening one's perspective, and as a graduate of Henley Business School Africa and as a former professional athlete, I believe it is crucial that athletes start thinking beyond the pitch by furthering their education.” Dean and Director of Henley Business School Africa, Jon Foster Pedley said: “Working along with The Beast Foundation, we will collectively assist sports-people to gain the business skills and qualifications that will help them transition from a playing career into that of entrepreneurs, managers and leaders.” BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE
