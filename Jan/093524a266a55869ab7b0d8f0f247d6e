Rustenburg - A 25-year-old man was gunned down in a suspected gang-related shooting in Helenvale, Gqeberha, in the Eastern Cape on Wednesday. Police spokesperson Captain Andre Beetge said witnesses heard a shot being fired in Deverill Road, Helenvale, at 3am. "Due to the darkness, they could not see anything, but by 06:00, they found the body of a young male on the sidewalk. He was identified as the 25-year-old Keenan Francis, and it was found that he had sustained one gunshot wound to his head. "The motive for the killing is unknown, but it is suspected to be gang-related. A murder case was opened at Gelvandale SAPS," he said.

"A fight broke out, and the suspect stabbed the deceased in the chest with a knife. The victim was rushed to the nearby hospital in an ambulance, where he succumbed to the injury." He said the 47-year-old man was arrested on January 2. He appeared in the  Botshabelo Magistrate's Court on Tuesday and was released on warning.
