Ain Sefra sits about 3,280 feet (1,000 meters) above sea level and is surrounded by the Atlas Mountains, near the Algerian-Moroccan border, according to the website LiveScience.com The Sahara Desert is more commonly known for its hot and dry climate, making the snowfall a very rare occurrence. Temperatures in the town often reach 35 degrees Celsius in July and August. Overnight, the mercury in the Algerian town is currently plummeting to -2℃, the UK’s Daily Mail reported on Wednesday. The snowfall has left incredible patterns across dunes of the Sahara Desert after temperatures plummeted below zero, local media reported.
