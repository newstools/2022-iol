Pretoria – A 48-year-old woman was arrested on Thursday in Bedfordview, Johannesburg, after she was found in possession of  29 rhino horns with an estimated street value of R6 million. According to Captain Ndivhuwo Mulamu, police were following up an on-going investigation related to a Kempton Park case in which suspects were arrested after they found in possession of rhino horns in September 2021. Mulamu said the investigation led the Hawks to a residential estate in Senderwood, Bedfordview, east of Johannesburg. “Upon arrival, police searched the premises and inside the garage, travelling suitcases were discovered wrapped in plastic ready for distribution. Police searched the luggage and inside (there) was grocery items and brown boxes as well as scrap laptops.” Inside the boxes, police recovered rhino horns wrapped in heavy foil. Among other seized items, were 29 rhino horns weighing 51.94 kilograms with an estimated street value of R6 million, eight scrap laptops, four weighing scales, and two heavy cutting machines. The woman was immediately placed under arrest and is expected to appear in the Germiston Regional court on Friday. IOL
