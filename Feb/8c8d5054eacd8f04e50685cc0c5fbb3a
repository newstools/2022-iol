MILAN - Giorgio Armani switched off the music to hold his Milan fashion show in silence on Sunday out of respect for the people caught in the Ukrainian conflict. Models strutted down the catwalk in an eerie quiet, interrupted by applause from the audience, wearing short jackets in pastel hues and shiny, sequined black and silver dresses. "My decision not to use any music was taken as a sign of respect towards the people involved in the unfolding tragedy in Ukraine," read a post across a black banner on the fashion designer's Twitter account. "The best thing to do is send a message that we don't want to celebrate because something very disturbing is happening around us," the designer later said on the sidelines of the show. Armani's designs brought down the curtain on Milan's fashion week for the 2022/23 fall/winter collections, which hosted mainly in-person catwalk shows rather than digital  presentations, including by the likes of Prada, Gucci and Dolce & Gabbana. Ukrainian and Russian officials will meet for talks at a venue on the Belarusian border with Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's office said on Sunday. Russian troops on Sunday entered Ukraine's second city, Kharkiv. Russia's President Vladimir Putin defied mounting sanctions and recriminations from the West as the country’s military pushed deeper into Ukraine on Thursday, attacking strategic airfields and advancing toward major cities.
