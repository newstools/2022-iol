The world’s top 10 countries spending the most time on their screens: According to the research: Nicolas Finet, Co-Founder and CMO at Sortlist has revealed why the calculator was created and the importance of taking a digital detox every so often: “Over the past 18 months or so we have spent more time behind a screen than ever. As a result of the pandemic, many people have been forced to work from home, spend copious amounts of time on Zoom calls and used their free time to scroll social media and utilise the array of apps at our disposal, but all of this time spent online can build up. Without even knowing, we spend a lot of time behind a screen and because of this, we wanted to create the calculator to enable users to fully understand the extent of our digital lives and where the majority of our time is spent and how this compares to countries across the world. In today’s world the majority of day to day tasks are completed online and this isn’t a bad thing, but it’s important that we remind ourselves that there is more to enjoy than just social media and online browsing. Taking a digital detox can be extremely beneficial and there are a number of steps you can take to have some time away from your screen including: Taking a digital detox isn’t always easy and temptation can get the better of us, but if you’re persistent and enjoy some time away from your screen, it’s very likely you’ll reap the benefits from doing so.” BUSINESS REPORT
