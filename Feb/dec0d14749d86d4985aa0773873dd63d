Johannesburg - 2022 has gotten off to a very positive start for the South African automotive industry, with new vehicle sales increasing by 19.5% versus the same month last year. According to Naamsa, the Automotive Business Council, a total of 41 382 vehicles were sold last month. Passenger vehicle sales led the way with 30 037 units and a 26.6% year-on-year gain, with the rental car industry contributing a noteworthy 15.3% to the tally. Light commercial vehicle sales grew by just 3.8%, while the medium and heavy commercial sectors registered declines of 4.3% and 9.6% respectively. New vehicle exports were also down year-on-year, by 9.3%, although new model introductions during the year are expected to improve the outlook. On the sales front Toyota led the way as always, with a total tally of 12 480. It was followed by Volkswagen (5393) and Suzuki (3232).
