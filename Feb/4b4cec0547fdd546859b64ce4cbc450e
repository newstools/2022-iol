GLOBAL credit rating agency Moody’s is acquiring  a majority (51 percent) stake in the Africa-focused rating agency Global Credit Rating Company (GCR) for an undisclosed sum, a statement from Moody’s said. GCR’s operations span Africa, including in South Africa, Nigeria, Senegal, Kenya, and Mauritius. “GCR’s ratings play a significant role in the growth of Africa’s financial markets by providing critical insights into credit across a range of economies and sectors,” Moody’s president and chief executive Rob Fauber said. “This transaction will enable us to build on our deep local market insights and a quarter century of growth across the continent. It will also provide the opportunity to further develop solutions that meet a range of customer needs, including credit ratings, credit risk solutions, and ESG (environmental, social and governance factors) capabilities,” said GCR chief executive Marc Joffe.
