Cape Town - President Cyril Ramaphosa used his State of the Nation Address to share how two young unemployed South Africans used their R350 Social Relief of Distress grant to start small businesses.  This has caused a bit of a frenzy on Twitter. Ramaphosa also announced the extension of the R350 SRD grant for at least another year. The grant supports over 10 million unemployed beneficiaries, however, it is the two citizens who used the money to begin business which has Twitter users scratching their heads. “Mr Thando Makhubu from Soweto received the R350 grant for seven months last year, and saved it to open an ice-cream store that employs four people,” Ramaphosa said during the Sona. “Mr Lindokuhle Msomi, an unemployed TV producer from KwaMashu Hostel, saved the R350 grant for nine months to start a fast food stall and support his family,” Ramaphosa added. Some on Twitter questioned the practicality of starting a business by saving the grant needed by the most vulnerable, when, they argued, that the alotted R350 granted was not enough to support the basic necessities such as food for a month. “Opening Ice cream shop with R350 SRD that means this person was not hungry mos or I am I thinking to much to it,” a Twitter user questions. #SONA2022 Opening Ice cream shop with R350 SRD that means this person was not hungry mos or I am I thinking to much to it Another suggested the president is ‘smoking something’.

But he was non-committal in providing a response, saying all would be revealed during his Budget Speech later this month. “I would imagine the Head of State would not have made the announcement if he has not interacted with his minister of finance. So I don't want to say whether the money is there, but there has been a consultation before such an announcement,” Godongwana replied. Meanwhile, others said they would prefer to have jobs than to depend on the R350 grant. You can’t be proud of giving people R350 a month 😩 #SONA2022 Voting out the ANC is now a matter of life and death!! Solutions for the youth ke R350 and to be teachers Assistants??
