Pretoria - Neighbours became concerned after a pungent smell, and a swarm of flies started coming from one of their neighbours' house whom they had not seen for days together with her son. The neighbours then got in touch with the woman’s brother, who lives in another area. The brother called the police and asked them to check on his sister and her son at their house in Letlhabile, near Brits. When the police arrived, they found the door open. There were two bodies inside. 48-year-old Emily Mashabela ‘s half-naked body was found lying on the couch. Her 10-year-old son, Thabiso’s body was found inside his room. “At this stage, the police cannot confirm the cause or the motive of the killings.
