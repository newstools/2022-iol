I definitely know that, but I will be speaking to him very, very soon.” Prince Bambindlovu further explained that they were happy that there would now be peace and stability for the Zulu Royal household. “We have never squabbled, even in the beginning, but this is a big family and I can’t talk for it all, but we are still on good terms with our brothers and we love each other because our late father the King ensured that even when he is no more, we would be united,” Prince Bambindlovu said. samkelo.mtshali@inl.co.za Political Bureau
